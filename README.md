# BMGT404 
This repository is for the BMGT404 team project for the scheduler application.

# Purpose and Subject
We all have those days when there are a million things to do, and we don't know how we're going to get it all done. It's easy to become overwhelmed by the vast quantity of tasks that we must do from day to day. One study, conducted by the Harvard Business Review, showed that 90% of people wasted valuable time through poor time management. In order to improve time management and productivity, our team is proposing to develop a python application that allows users to add important events, tasks, or school assignments to a scheduler and be reminded when something on their schedule needs to be done. 

# Workflow
User registers for an account on the home page of the application 
To register for an account a user needs to input a valid email and password. To ensure the validity of the email and password, we will use string functions to make sure they meet our specifications. We will also send the user a unique code to the email they provide and ask them to input it on the next page. This will allow us to ensure the email is an actual email they can access.
The user logs in with their email and password 
A blank grid will appear representing the schedule for todayâ€™s date
A user will click an icon to add a new item for a date, specifying the name of the item, what kind of item is is (event / general task / school assignment), the associated date, and when they would like to be reminded of it (1 week before, 1 day before, or the day of, or they can choose not to be reminded)
The item will appear on the schedule for that date
The user will be able to view schedules for different dates by entering the date in a date field
Users will be able to delete items from their schedule
Emails will be sent out to remind users about their schedule according to the option they selected
Users can log out and still view their schedule once they log back in
